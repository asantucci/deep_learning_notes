# Neural Networks from Scratch
This is a personal repository which will be built for learning purposes. 
I plan to implement deep learning algorithms from scratch using Python.
The code will be based off of Andrew Ng's Coursera course on Neural Networks and Deep Learning.
We may additionally incorporate notes as well.
