# Neural Networks from Scratch
This is a personal repository which will be built for learning purposes. 
I plan to document Andrew Ng's Coursera course on Neural Networks and Deep Learning; the sole output file of interest will be `NN.pdf`. Source code for homework assignments will be stored in a separate private repository so as to preserve the course honor code.
