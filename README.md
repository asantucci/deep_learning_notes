# Deep Learning Notes
This is a personal repository which will be built for learning purposes.
I plan to document Andrew Ng's Coursera Deep Learning specialization; the sole output file of interest will be `NN.pdf`. In addition, I will create a separate set of notes based on the speciality for Tensorflow: Data and Deployment. This output file will be called `tf.pdf`.

Source code for homework assignments will be stored in a separate private repository so as to preserve the course honor code.
